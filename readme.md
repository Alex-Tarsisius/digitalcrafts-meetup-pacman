# overview of how web pages work

- 3 parts: html, css, javascript

## what is html

- it stands for hypertext markup language
- tags are meant to structure your content
- content is text and images
- so, you might have a paragraph (as a p tag) and an anchor tag (an a tag).
  - the anchor tag is nested inside of the paragraph tag

## what is css

- the tags you write in your html have to be drawn to the screen
- for every tag, the browser draws a rectangle
- you have to tell the browser how to draw the rectangles
- there are default styles, and you can specify custom ones.
- styles are declared in three parts
- the best way to associate styles with an element on the page? use classes

## what is javascript

- what is a variable?
- what is a function?
  - it's like a recipe

## keyboard shortcuts in vs code:

- move line up/down: opt + up/down
- toggle comment: cmd + /
